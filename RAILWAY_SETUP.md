# Railway Deployment Setup - ChatGPT Walkthrough

Copy and paste this into ChatGPT to get step-by-step guidance:

---

**PROMPT FOR CHATGPT:**

I'm deploying a Flask admin portal to Railway. Here's my setup info:

- **Repository**: hrg-site on GitHub (contains Procfile, requirements.txt, admin_server.py)
- **Domain**: howardresourcegroup.com (hosted on Cloudflare)
- **Goal**: Deploy Flask app to Railway and access it at admin.howardresourcegroup.com

Please walk me through:

1. Creating a Railway account and connecting my GitHub repo
2. Waiting for deployment to complete
3. Adding environment variables (ENVIRONMENT, ADMIN_PASSWORD, FLASK_SECRET_KEY)
4. Finding my Railway URL
5. Setting up Cloudflare DNS to route admin.howardresourcegroup.com to Railway
6. Testing the login at admin.howardresourcegroup.com

After each step, ask me to confirm it's done before moving to the next one. Be specific about what buttons to click and what to look for.

**THEN TELL CHATGPT:**

- Your GitHub username
- Your Cloudflare login email
- A password you want for the admin portal

It will guide you through the entire process interactively.
